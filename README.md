## Introduction

### What is Django?

Who doesn't want to build applications super fast with a great structure and simple framework? We also need phenomenal security and user authentication built in to make sure we have a reliable system. One of the best frameworks for doing this is Django. Django is an open source framework for building web apps quickly, and with very little code. In this course, we'll cover the essentials and we'll build a working application from start to finish. We go through a signup, login, creation and deletion of content. The whole full. I'm Leticia Portella, I'm an oceanographer that fell in love with programming and after teaching myself how to program, I've been working as a software engineer for many years. Join me in this LinkedIn learning course. As we dive into Django, and start building your first application.

### What you will need to start a Django project

There are a few things you need to get the most out of this course. You will need a Python 3.8 virtualenv and you must install Django 3.2, but should also work with later versions of Django. This is a simple stall. You'll just beep install Django and you'll get the latest version. We also need an editor, I'll use VS Code, and a browser, I'll use Chrome, but feel free to choose the tools you think are best for you. You might want to have at least some familiarity with HTTP and an idea of its methods. This will help you have a solid foundation and understand everything even better. And finally, we're going to host our exercises on GitHub, so you can check it out. If you need a refresher on any of this, check out some courses here in the library.
